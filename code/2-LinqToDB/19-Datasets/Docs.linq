// ADO.NET,predates Entity Framework (EF), it was a foundational layer for many data access operations in .NET
 // There is LINQ to Datasets
including some aspects of LINQ to Entities.
// ADO.NET DataSets provide a disconnected data architecture 
// that allows you to work with in-memory data collections 
// independent of the data source. 

// Unlike LINQ to Entities, which operates on an Entity Framework context 
// tightly integrated with a database, DataSets and their related classes 
// are more generalized and do not require a specific ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer. 
// Instead, DataSets are part of the ADO.NET framework and can represent data from multiple sources like databases, XML files, or other structured data.
