For this course, I’ve chosen SQLite as the database solution
to simplify the setup and ensure a smooth learning experience for everyone. 

Unlike local SQL Server database files (MDFs), 
which often create compatibility headaches due to version mismatches, 
SQLite is, self-contained, lightweight and highly portable. 

It doesn’t require any server installation, making it an excellent choice for teaching and learning.


To work with SQLite in Visual Studio, we’ll need to install some additional extensions. 

VisualStudio.Data.Sqlite 
EF Core Power Tools
